The controls are as follows:

WASD or Arrow Keys or Mouse

Pilot the ship to the power up in the top left. There you can collect coins which will act as the way for the player to continue forward within the game. Click on the planet in the middle to see a lesson. 

If you want to navigate away from the lesson, you need to restart the game and start from the top.
